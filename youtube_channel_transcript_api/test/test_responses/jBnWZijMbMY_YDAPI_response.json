Grand prize winner also wins an 8\" Victorionox Fibrox Chef's Knife and will have their recipe featured on Part II of this episode!  No purchase necessary or whatever.  Winners are determined solely by me and what I think of your food.\n\nZelda: Breath of the Wild may very well be the first open-world RPG developed for the Switch, released in 2017, not including DLC, to so prominently feature cooking in its story and strategy.  At least it will be in my mind until someone angrily corrects me in the comments.  Seldom have fruits and vegetables dancing in a wok over an open fire yielded so many hearty stews, stamina potions, and pixelated monstrosities.\n\nRecipe: https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/2017/8/01/zelda-monster-cake\n\nMusic: \"XXV\" by Broke for Free\nhttps://soundcloud.com/broke-for-free\n\nPlease support Binging with Babish!

I've been terrified to take on this digital dessert for years, but after developing a recipe using a buttery-sweet brioche, I think it's finally ready for the main stage.
